Form and Function 2021
Background
This tutorial will describe how to use the ALPACA software to compare and contrast 3D models of bird skulls through the use of landmarks. The example provided here will be studying various skulls of waterfowl. 3 skulls will be used in this tutorial: Anas platyrhynchos, Oxyura jamaicensis, and Anser Anser.
	The mallard duck, Anas platyrhynchos, is a generalist, while the other two species of waterfowl have specialized diets. Because of their unique diets, they are ideal for morphological analysis. 
 	The ALPACA software is available through the SlicerMorph extension available through the 3D slicer application. 

Download the appropriate software
Download 3D slicer software https://download.slicer.org 
Get slicermorph extension (ALPACA is part of this)
On 3D slicer, go to extensions manager module to search for and install the SlicerMorph extension

Searching for good models 
Find species that are phylogenetically related to one other. Ideally you want to find one generalist species and two specialist species
Our skulls were chosen with reference to Olsen 2017 paper

Here is what to search for in a good 3D model:
Find intact, unbroken skulls with no fractures or significant damage
Search for high resolution models, the higher the better
Ideal formats for model (ply, etc)
Convert stl files to ply format. 
Want skulls that are not too different from one another, or else it will be difficult to compare landmarks
Download your chosen models in a designated folder on your computer
